I believe you have the jury system back to front. How it should work:
A user uploads some content that is on or over the NSFW line
Staff flag it for a jury assessment without the content provider being informed
Should the jury return an "all clear" response, then the nothing is done and the content is left unchanged
Should the jury return an "NSFW" response, then the content provider is notified that the content has been flagged for review
and they can request a review of the outcome and submit mitigating reasons for the outcome to be overturned.
The mitigating reasons along with the content is sent out to another jury for review.
Should the jury return an "all clear" response, then the nothing is done and the content is left unchanged
Should the jury return an "NSFW" response, then the content provider is notified that the content has been marked NSFW

This process can be used to ensure content is appropriate for kids:
A user uploads some content that is marked "Safe for kids"
Staff flag it for a jury assessment without the content provider being informed
Should the jury return an "all clear" response, then the nothing is done and the content is left unchanged
Should the jury return an "PG13" response, then the content provider is notified that the content has been flagged for review
and they can request a review of the outcome and submit mitigating reasons for the outcome to be overturned.
The mitigating reasons along with the content is sent out to another jury for review.
Should the jury return an "all clear" response, then the nothing is done and the content is left unchanged
Should the jury return an "PG13" response, then the content provider is notified that the content has been marked PG13

This ensures your staff only highlight content for the first review and the community takes control of the entire process 
from that point.
You could even outsource the first step to users across the globe to highlight content and they could earn tokens for this work.
They will be rated on the accuracy of their flagging trends. Should they have a high percentage of highlighted content that
receives an "All Clear" from the first jury, they will be dropped from this function or receive a low number of tokens.
The higher percentage of either NSFW or PG13 outcomes from the second jury pays more tokens.

This would increase cashflow and dilute control even further.
